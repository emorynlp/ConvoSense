      "Speaker (B): Well son, it's a bit complicated. But essentially, it's because of the Bernoulli principle.",
      "Listener (A): What's that?",
      "Speaker (B): It's a principle of fluid dynamics. It states that when a fluid is flowing through a pipe or tube, the faster the fluid flows, the lower the pressure. And when you have something like an airplane wing, the upper surface is curved and so the air has to travel further to get around it. That means that the air moves faster over the top of the wing than underneath it. And because of this difference in speed, there's also a difference in pressure. The higher pressure underneath tries to push the wing up, and eventually overcomes gravity and keeps the plane in the air.",
      "Listener (A): Wow, that's incredible! So it's like the wing is being pushed up by the air itself?",

Additionally, microchips could also be used to control devices such as prosthetic limbs or pacemakers. So if there was a problem with your prosthetic limb, doctors could remotely adjust the settings on the microchip to fix it.

So, tell me a little bit about your theory. What's it all about?\nListener (A): Well, my theory is based on the idea that there are hidden patterns in the universe that we can't see with our naked eye. I believe that these patterns hold the key to understanding many of the mysteries of our world. For example, I think they could help us unlock the secrets of gravity and dark matter.\nSpeaker (B): Interesting... can you give me an example of one of these hidden patterns?\nListener (A): Well, one pattern I found was what I call a 'gravity wave.' It's a wave-like pattern in space-time that appears when two massive objects interact. This pattern is too subtle to be seen directly, but I was able to detect it using sophisticated equipment. Once I had this data, I was able to use mathematical models to reverse-engineer the wave and reconstruct its shape. And what I found was incredible \u2013 this wave actually holds information about the objects that created it! Based on this information, we should be able to learn things like the mass and spin of those objects \u2013 things that were previously thought impossible to know without directly observing them.\nSpeaker (B): That sounds like a really fascinating discovery!
