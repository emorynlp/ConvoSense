      "Speaker (A): Why don't we take a look at the numbers and see if a restaurant is something that could work for you? Let's start with some basic costs. For a small restaurant, you're looking at an initial investment of around $50,000. This includes the cost of rent, equipment, and supplies. Then you have to factor in ongoing costs like food and labor.",
      "Listener (B): Wow, that's a lot of money! I'm not sure if I can afford that kind of investment.",
      "Speaker (A): It is a significant investment, but it is possible to get financing from a bank or investors. Another option is to start small with a food truck or catering business and then grow into a brick-and-mortar location when you have more capital.",
      "Listener (B): That's definitely something to consider. I like the idea of starting small and then growing my business as my finances allow.",
      "Speaker (A): Okay, let's take a look at some other options then. Have you thought about opening a retail store?",
      "Listener (B): Yes, actually, I have been considering opening a clothing boutique.",

      "Listener (A): Really? That would be amazing! Thank you so much.",
      "Speaker (B): No problem at all. So, one of the things that I do is make sure to chew slowly and evenly. This helps to make the gum last longer and prevents it from getting too sweet. Additionally, I try to avoid breathing through my mouth while I'm chewing; this can cause the gum to lose its flavor faster. Finally, I make sure to take small breaks while chewing so that my jaw doesn't get too tired.",
