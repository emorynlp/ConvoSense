Regulatory signs tell you what you must or must not do on the road. Warning signs warn you of potential hazards ahead. And guide signs provide information about where you are and which way to go. Now, let's talk about parallel parking. Can you tell me how to parallel park?\n\nQuestion: What is a breakdown of the last thing said into a series of required subevents?\n\nAnswers:\n(1) checking for any obstructions or obstacles in the parking space, such as poles or trees.\n(2) checking for any obstructions or obstacles in the parking space, such as potholes or debris.\n(3) checking for any obstructions or obstacles in the parking space.\n(4) checking for any obstructions or obstacles in the parking space before starting to parallel park.\n(5) being aware of your surroundings and adjusting your speed accordingly.\n(6) checking for any obstructions or obstacles in the parking space, such as parked cars or pedestrians\n(7) being aware of your surroundings and anticipating potential obstacles.\n(8) checking for any obstructions or obstacles in the parking space, such as parked cars or trees.\n(9) checking for any obstructions or obstacles in the parking space\n(10) checking for any obstructions or obstacles in the parking space, such as curbs or trees.\n-------------------------------------\nGroup answers together that are paraphrases, identical in meaning, or very similar in meaning to one another\n\nYour groupings should ensure that:\n\n- Answers with SIMILAR MEANING are in the SAME GROUP, even if their language and words are not exactly the same!\n- Answers that are not similar to any other answer are isolated into their own group of size 1.\n\nPlease keep in mind: Referring to the same conversational participant in different ways (e.g. by their role in the conversation vs their name, etc.) does NOT change the underlying meaning, so such answers should still be grouped together.\n\nGroup 1:\n(",
