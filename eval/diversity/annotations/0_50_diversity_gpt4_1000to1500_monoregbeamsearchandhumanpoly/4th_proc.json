    "context": "Listener (B): Hey, accountant! I'm thinking about starting my own business and I was wondering if you could help me out with some numbers.\nSpeaker (A): Sure thing, Kamron. What kind of business are you thinking of starting?\nListener (B): I'm not quite sure yet. I know that I want it to be small and local, something that will serve the community. Do you have any recommendations?\nSpeaker (A): Well, it sounds like you're interested in something service-oriented. Have you considered opening a restaurant or a retail store? Those are always popular options.\nListener (B): Yeah, I've been thinking about a restaurant. I think that would be really fun. But I'm not sure if it's the right fit for me.\nSpeaker (A): Why don't we take a look at the numbers and see if a restaurant is something that could work for you? Let's start with some basic costs. For a small restaurant, you're looking at an initial investment of around $50,000. This includes the cost of rent, equipment, and supplies. Then you have to factor in ongoing costs like food and labor.\nListener (B): Wow, that's a lot of money! I'm not sure if I can afford that kind of investment.\nSpeaker (A): It is a significant investment, but it is possible to get financing from a bank or investors. Another option is to start small with a food truck or catering business and then grow into a brick-and-mortar location when you have more capital.\nListener (B): That's definitely something to consider. I like the idea of starting small and then growing my business as my finances allow.\nSpeaker (A): Okay, let's take a look at some other options then. Have you thought about opening a retail store?\nListener (B): Yes, actually, I have been considering opening a clothing boutique.\nSpeaker (A): That's great! A clothing boutique can be a really successful business venture if done correctly. The initial investment for this type of business is typically lower than that of a restaurant since you won't need to purchase as much equipment or supplies. However, your ongoing costs will be higher because you'll need to stock your inventory regularly",
