      "Speaker (A): Everything just feels so overwhelming. I don't know how to deal with my emotions and they always seem to be in charge. I'll get angry or upset over something small and it feels like it takes over everything. And then afterwards, I'll feel so guilty and ashamed of myself. But it's like, no matter what I do, I can't seem to stop it from happening.",
      "Listener (B): It sounds like you're feeling a lot of anger and frustration, which is understandable given what you've said. Can you tell me more about why you think this is happening? Is there anything in particular that seems to trigger these feelings for you?",
      "Speaker (A): Honestly, it feels like everything sets me off lately. Everything just seems so hard and stressful all the time. My job is really demanding, my family life is chaotic...I just feel like I can't catch a break. And then on top of all that, there's this pandemic going on which just makes everything feel even more out of control. It's like the world is against me or something. All of these things build up inside of me until I just explode over something small and stupid. And then afterwards, I regret it so much because it only makes things worse but...I don't know how to stop myself from feeling this way or acting out like this anymore..",

What kind of business are you thinking of starting?\nListener (B): I'm not quite sure yet. I know that I want it to be small and local, something that will serve the community. Do you have any recommendations?\nSpeaker (A): Well, it sounds like you're interested in something service-oriented. Have you considered opening a restaurant or a retail store? Those are always popular options.\nListener (B): Yeah, I've been thinking about a restaurant. I think that would be really fun. But I'm not sure if it's the right fit for me.\nSpeaker (A): Why don't we take a look at the numbers and see if a restaurant is something that could work for you? Let's start with some basic costs. For a small restaurant, you're looking at an initial investment of around $50,000. This includes the cost of rent, equipment, and supplies. Then you have to factor in ongoing costs like food and labor.\nListener (B): Wow, that's a lot of money! I'm not sure if I can afford that kind of investment.\nSpeaker (A): It is a significant investment, but it is possible to get financing from a bank or investors. Another option is to start small with a food truck or catering business and then grow into a brick-and-mortar location when you have more capital.\nListener (B): That's definitely something to consider. I like the idea of starting small and then growing my business as my finances allow.\nSpeaker (A): Okay, let's take a look at some other options then. Have you thought about opening a retail store?\nListener (B): Yes, actually, I have been considering opening a clothing boutique.\nSpeaker (A): That's great! A clothing boutique can be a really successful business venture if done correctly. The initial investment for this type of business is typically lower than that of a restaurant since you won't need to purchase as much equipment or supplies. However, your ongoing costs will be higher because you'll need to stock your inventory regularly",
