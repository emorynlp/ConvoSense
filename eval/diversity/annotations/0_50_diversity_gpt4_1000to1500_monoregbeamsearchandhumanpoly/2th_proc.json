Can you tell us a little bit about your experiences with discrimination?\nListener (A): Sure. I think that discrimination is something that I've experienced in a lot of different ways throughout my life. I was always one of the only kids of color in my school, and I remember feeling like I didn't really fit in or belong. People would make racist jokes and comments around me, and it made me feel really uncomfortable and alone. I'm also queer, so I've experienced homophobia and transphobia as well. Discrimination is something that can really take a toll on someone's mental health, and I know it's something that I've struggled with at times. But sharing my experiences and speaking out against discrimination is something that's really important to me.\nSpeaker (B): That sounds very difficult. Thank you for sharing that with us.

Can you tell us a little bit about your experiences with discrimination?\nListener (A): Sure. I think that discrimination is something that I've experienced in a lot of different ways throughout my life. I was always one of the only kids of color in my school, and I remember feeling like I didn't really fit in or belong. People would make racist jokes and comments around me, and it made me feel really uncomfortable and alone. I'm also queer, so I've experienced homophobia and transphobia as well. Discrimination is something that can really take a toll on someone's mental health, and I know it's something that I've struggled with at times.

      "Listener (A): Dad, how does that plane stay in the air?",
      "Speaker (B): Well son, it's a bit complicated. But essentially, it's because of the Bernoulli principle.",
      "Listener (A): What's that?",
      "Speaker (B): It's a principle of fluid dynamics. It states that when a fluid is flowing through a pipe or tube, the faster the fluid flows, the lower the pressure. And when you have something like an airplane wing, the upper surface is curved and so the air has to travel further to get around it. That means that the air moves faster over the top of the wing than underneath it. And because of this difference in speed, there's also a difference in pressure. The higher pressure underneath tries to push the wing up, and eventually overcomes gravity and keeps the plane in the air.",
      "Listener (A): Wow, that's incredible! So it's like the wing is being pushed up by the air itself?",
      "Speaker (B): Exactly. And that's why it's called lift.",
