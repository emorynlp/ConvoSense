But essentially, it's because of the Bernoulli principle.\nListener (A): What's that?\nSpeaker (B): It's a principle of fluid dynamics. It states that when a fluid is flowing through a pipe or tube, the faster the fluid flows, the lower the pressure. And when you have something like an airplane wing, the upper surface is curved and so the air has to travel further to get around it. That means that the air moves faster over the top of the wing than underneath it. And because of this difference in speed, there's also a difference in pressure. The higher pressure underneath tries to push the wing up, and eventually overcomes gravity and keeps the plane in the air.\nListener (A): Wow, that's incredible! So it's like the wing is being pushed up by the air itself?\nSpeaker (B): Exactly. And that's why it's called lift.",

It states that when a fluid is flowing through a pipe or tube, the faster the fluid flows, the lower the pressure. And when you have something like an airplane wing, the upper surface is curved and so the air has to travel further to get around it.

Can you tell me a little bit about your job?\nListener (B): Absolutely! Marketing is all about creating and managing campaigns to promote products or services. It's a great way to build awareness for brands and get people talking about them. There are a lot of different aspects to the job, from planning and executing campaigns to analyzing data and measuring results. It's a challenging and exciting field, and there are always new opportunities to learn and grow.\nSpeaker (A): That sounds really interesting!
