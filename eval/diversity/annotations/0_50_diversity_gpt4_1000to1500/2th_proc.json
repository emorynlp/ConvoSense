    "context": "Listener (A): Dad, how does that plane stay in the air?\nSpeaker (B): Well son, it's a bit complicated. But essentially, it's because of the Bernoulli principle.\nListener (A): What's that?\nSpeaker (B): It's a principle of fluid dynamics. It states that when a fluid is flowing through a pipe or tube, the faster the fluid flows, the lower the pressure. And when you have something like an airplane wing, the upper surface is curved and so the air has to travel further to get around it. That means that the air moves faster over the top of the wing than underneath it. And because of this difference in speed, there's also a difference in pressure. The higher pressure underneath tries to push the wing up, and eventually overcomes gravity and keeps the plane in the air.\nListener (A): Wow, that's incredible! So it's like the wing is being pushed up by the air itself?\nSpeaker (B): Exactly. And that's why it's called lift.",

    "prompt": "-------------------------------------\nListener (A): Dad, how does that plane stay in the air?\nSpeaker (B): Well son, it's a bit complicated. But essentially, it's because of the Bernoulli principle.\nListener (A): What's that?\nSpeaker (B): It's a principle of fluid dynamics. It states that when a fluid is flowing through a pipe or tube, the faster the fluid flows, the lower the pressure. And when you have something like an airplane wing, the upper surface is curved and so the air has to travel further to get around it. That means that the air moves faster over the top of the wing than underneath it. And because of this difference in speed, there's also a difference in pressure. The higher pressure underneath tries to push the wing up, and eventually overcomes gravity and keeps the plane in the air.\nListener (A): Wow, that's incredible! So it's like the wing is being pushed up by the air itself?\nSpeaker (B): Exactly.

      "Speaker (A): So, what do you think?",
      "Listener (B): Well, it's definitely a well-written novel. I'm impressed with your knowledge of the historical period and your attention to detail. The characters are also very well-developed and believable.",
      "Speaker (A): Thank you! I'm glad you like it.",
      "Listener (B): However, I do have some concerns. Specifically, I'm not sure how sympathetic the main character will be to readers. She's quite conflicted, and she doesn't seem to have a clear allegiance to either side in the war.",
      "Speaker (A): That was intentional. I wanted her to be a complex character who wasn't easily pigeonholed into one category or another. I wanted readers to see her as a human being with flaws and contradictions, just like everyone else.",
      "Listener (B): I see what you're going for, but I'm not sure if it will work in practice. Readers might find her confusing and frustrating, instead of sympathetic. But it's your call in the end.",
      "Speaker (A): I'm willing to take that risk. I think it's important to show that there were many people during the Civil War who didn't fit neatly into one side or the other. They were just trying to survive and make the best of a bad situation.",
