      "Listener (A): What excites you about drama?",
      "Speaker (B): Well, I find it's a communicative way to study people and you learn how to read people in drama. So usually I can understand what people are saying even though they might be lying.",
      "Listener (A): That would be useful.",
      "Speaker (B): Yeah, it's very useful for me as well. I'm an English lecturer, so I use a lot of drama in my classes such as role plays. And I ask my students to create mini-dramas. They really respond well. At the moment, I'm hoping to get onto a Ph.D course. I'd like to concentrate on Asian drama and try to bring Asian theatre to the world's attention. I don't know how successful I would be, but here's hoping.",
      "Listener (A): Oh, I'm sure you'll be successful. Now, Claire, what do you do for stage fright?",
