What kind of business are you thinking of starting?\nListener (B): I'm not quite sure yet. I know that I want it to be small and local, something that will serve the community. Do you have any recommendations?\nSpeaker (A): Well, it sounds like you're interested in something service-oriented. Have you considered opening a restaurant or a retail store? Those are always popular options.\nListener (B): Yeah, I've been thinking about a restaurant. I think that would be really fun. But I'm not sure if it's the right fit for me.\nSpeaker (A): Why don't we take a look at the numbers and see if a restaurant is something that could work for you? Let's start with some basic costs. For a small restaurant, you're looking at an initial investment of around $50,000. This includes the cost of rent, equipment, and supplies. Then you have to factor in ongoing costs like food and labor.\nListener (B): Wow, that's a lot of money! I'm not sure if I can afford that kind of investment.\nSpeaker (A): It is a significant investment, but it is possible to get financing from a bank or investors. Another option is to start small with a food truck or catering business and then grow into a brick-and-mortar location when you have more capital.\nListener (B): That's definitely something to consider. I like the idea of starting small and then growing my business as my finances allow.\nSpeaker (A): Okay, let's take a look at some other options then. Have you thought about opening a retail store?\nListener (B): Yes, actually, I have been considering opening a clothing boutique.\nSpeaker (A): That's great! A clothing boutique can be a really successful business venture if done correctly. The initial investment for this type of business is typically lower than that of a restaurant since you won't need to purchase as much equipment or supplies. However, your ongoing costs will be higher because you'll need to stock your inventory regularly",

But I'm not sure if it's the right fit for me.\nSpeaker (A): Why don't we take a look at the numbers and see if a restaurant is something that could work for you? Let's start with some basic costs. For a small restaurant, you're looking at an initial investment of around $50,000. This includes the cost of rent, equipment, and supplies. Then you have to factor in ongoing costs like food and labor.\nListener (B): Wow, that's a lot of money! I'm not sure if I can afford that kind of investment.\nSpeaker (A): It is a significant investment, but it is possible to get financing from a bank or investors. Another option is to start small with a food truck or catering business and then grow into a brick-and-mortar location when you have more capital.\nListener (B): That's definitely something to consider. I like the idea of starting small and then growing my business as my finances allow.\nSpeaker (A): Okay, let's take a look at some other options then. Have you thought about opening a retail store?\nListener (B): Yes, actually, I have been considering opening a clothing boutique.\nSpeaker (A): That's great! A clothing boutique can be a really successful business venture if done correctly. The initial investment for this type of business is typically lower than that of a restaurant since you won't need to purchase as much equipment or supplies. However, your ongoing costs will be higher because you'll need to stock your inventory regularly\n\nQuestion: What does Speaker want to do next?\n\nAnswers:\n(1) to ask the listener if they have any experience in running a retail store.\n(2) to suggest that the listener consider opening a pop-up shop as an alternative to a brick-and-mortar location.\n(3) to encourage the listener to research different types of clothing boutiques and see which one would work best for them.\n(4) to share some tips on how to run a successful clothing boutique, such as setting up a website or creating a social media presence.\n-------------------------------------\nGroup answers together that are paraphrases, identical in meaning, or very similar in meaning to one another\n\nYour groupings should ensure that:\n\n- Answers with SIMILAR MEANING are in the SAME GROUP, even if their language and words are not exactly the same!\n- Answers that are not similar to any other answer are isolated into their own group of size 1.\n\nPlease keep in mind: Referring to the same conversational participant in different ways (e.g. by their role in the conversation vs their name, etc.) does NOT change the underlying meaning, so such answers should still be grouped together.\n\nGroup 1:\n(",

      "Speaker (A): I've been thinking a lot lately about your future, and I think it's time for you to start thinking about what you want to do with your life. There are so many possibilities out there, and I know that you have the potential to be successful at anything you put your mind to. But it's important to make sure that you choose something that you're passionate about, because that's what will ultimately make you happy. So tell me, Scout, what are your dreams? What do you want to do with your life?",
      "Listener (B): I'm not really sure, Shira. I haven't thought about it much.",
      "Speaker (A): That's okay, most people don't. But it's important to start thinking about these things now, because the sooner you figure out what you want, the sooner you can start working towards making your dreams a reality. So, take your time and really think about it. What are your passions? What makes you happy? Once you figure that out, the rest will fall into place.",
