They also stay in the same place forever.\nListener: Right, have you ever tried removing one of those things? It would be easier to chip the rock away than to get the barnacles off.\nSpeaker: Exactly, and that's why scientists are trying to figure out what the barnacles glue is made of. It's considered one of the strongest adhesives in nature.\nListener: And it would have the advantage of being able to work on wet surfaces too.\nSpeaker: Precisely, and because it's natural protein, it probably wouldn't be harmful to people like so many synthetic glues in use today.\nListener: Think of all the ways doctors and dentists could use such a glue, mending broken bones, fasting false teeth.\nSpeaker: There could be countless uses. Scientists hope to learn soon exactly how the glue is made, so that people can make use of it.","type":"reaction_o","question":"How does Listener (or others) feel because of what Speaker just said?","a1":"impressed by the ingenuity of scientists who are studying nature to find innovative solutions to everyday problems.","a1source":"gpt","a2":"b is excited about the countless uses the glue can bring.","a2source":"cicero","id":"dream-0829","a1-reasonability":"sometimes/possible","a1-novelty":"new \u0026 detailed","a2-reasonability":"sometimes/possible","a2-novelty":"new \u0026 simple"},{"worker_id":"YKPDD2RHZKMG","task_id":"1e299d18-97ae-4fbc-8faa-1b30e9a1f20f","task_response_id":"2cb137df-e6c5-4cbd-90c9-3202521d7440","context":"Listener: Now please tell me something about your achievements in your work unit .\nSpeaker: All right .
